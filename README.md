# uber-etl-pipeline-dataengineering-project
The Uber ETL pipeline data engineering project aims to leverage a combination of tools and technologies to perform comprehensive data analytics on Uber's vast dataset. The project incorporates various components, including GCP Storage, Python programming language, Compute Instance, Mage Data Pipeline Tool, BigQuery, and Looker Studio.

The first step in the project is to extract the required data from Uber's data sources and load it into GCP Storage. Once the data is securely stored, the next phase involves transforming the data using Python, where it can be cleaned, standardized, and structured according to specific requirements. The transformed data is then loaded into BigQuery, Google's fully-managed, serverless data warehouse solution.

Using BigQuery's powerful querying capabilities, the project enables analysts and data scientists to perform complex analytics tasks, such as aggregating data, applying statistical models, and extracting meaningful insights from the Uber dataset. BigQuery's scalability and performance make it well-suited for handling large volumes of data efficiently.

To enhance the project's functionality, Looker Studio, a data visualization and business intelligence platform, is employed to create intuitive and interactive dashboards. These dashboards provide users with a user-friendly interface to explore and analyze the data visually, enabling them to make data-driven decisions effectively.

Throughout the project, the Mage Data Pipeline Tool plays a crucial role in orchestrating the various stages of the ETL process, ensuring data integrity, reliability, and scalability. It facilitates the seamless flow of data from extraction to transformation and ultimately to loading into BigQuery, simplifying the management of the entire data pipeline.

By leveraging the power of these tools and technologies, the Uber ETL pipeline data engineering project empowers Uber's analysts and decision-makers to gain valuable insights from their data, optimize operations, and make informed business decisions.
